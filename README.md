# Credit_card_scam

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing patterns in transaction data, the model will be able to identify potentially fraudulent activities, helping to prevent credit card scams.

Project Structure
Data Collection

Gather credit card transaction data from a reliable source.
Ensure the dataset includes labeled transactions (fraudulent or legitimate).
Data Preprocessing

Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
Normalize/standardize the data.
Feature selection and engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the data to understand distribution and relationships.
Identify any patterns or anomalies in fraudulent transactions.
Model Selection

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training

Train the selected models using the training dataset.
Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Compare performance to select the best model.
Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.
Deployment

Integrate the model into a real-time system for detecting fraudulent transactions.
Implement monitoring and maintenance routines.
